### Enhanced Company Code Onboarding Flow:
```
1. Company Admin ‚Üí Signs up + creates company profile
2. System generates unique company code (already implemented)
3. ‚ú® Company wallet created automatically via your Payman app
4. Admin shares company code with employees
5. Employee ‚Üí Signs up + enters company code during onboarding
6. ‚ú® Employee wallet created automatically + linked to company
7. Employee immediately has access to budget system!
```

### Company Code Integration Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **Self-Service**: Employees onboard themselves (no admin workload)

## Phase 1: Enhanced Payman Integration

### 1.1 Company Code + Wallet Integration
**Goal**: Seamlessly integrate wallet creation with your existing company code system

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Enhanced Company Creation Flow**
   ```typescript
   // When company admin creates company
   async function createCompanyWithWallet(companyData: CompanySetup) {
     // Create company in your database (existing logic)
     const company = await createCompany(companyData);
     
     // Generate company code (existing logic)  
     const companyCode = generateCompanyCode();
     
     // ‚ú® NEW: Initialize with main Payman wallet
     const mainWallet = await paymanService.getMainWallet();
     
     // Update company with wallet info
     await updateCompany(company.id, {
       joinCode: companyCode,
       paymanWalletId: mainWallet.id
     });
     
     return { company, companyCode, wallet: mainWallet };
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Employee Onboarding with Wallet Creation**
   ```typescript
   // When employee signs up with company code
   async function onboardEmployeeWithWallet(
     employeeData: SignUpFormValues, 
     companyCode: string
   ) {
     // Validate company code (existing logic)
     const company = await findCompanyByCode(companyCode);
     if (!company) throw new Error('Invalid company code');
     
     // Create employee account (existing logic)
     const employee = await createEmployee({
       ...employeeData,
       companyId: company.id
     });
     
     // ‚ú® NEW: Auto-create employee test payee
     const payee = await paymanService.createEmployeePayee(
       employee.name,
       employee._id.toString(),
       employee.email
     );
     
     // Link payee to employee
     await updateEmployee(employee.id, {
       paymanWalletId: payee.id  // Store payee ID for payments
     });
     
     return { employee, payee };
   }
   ```

3. **Unified Policy Management by Company Code**
   ```typescript
   interface PaymentPolicy {
     companyCode: string;  // Links to your existing system
     companyId: string;
     departmentId: string;
     employeeRole: string;
     dailyLimit: number;
     transactionLimit: number;
     approvalThreshold: number;
     allowedCategories: string[];
   }
   
   // Apply policies automatically when employee joins
   async function applyCompanyPolicies(employeeId: string, companyCode: string) {
     const policies = await getPoliciesByCompanyCode(companyCode);
     await assignPoliciesToEmployee(employeeId, policies);
   }
   ```

### 1.2 Company Code Dashboard Enhancement
**Goal**: Give company admins visibility into code-based onboarding

**Features**:
- View all employees who joined via company code
- Track wallet creation success/failures  
- Monitor new employee onboarding in real-time
- Regenerate company codes if needed
- Bulk policy application for code-based joiners

### 1.3 Employee Self-Service Wallet Management
**Goal**: Let employees manage their auto-created wallets

**Features**:
- View wallet balance and transaction history
- Connect personal wallet for reimbursements (optional)
- Update wallet preferences and notifications
- Request wallet permissions changes

## Phase 2: AI Agent Architecture

### 2.1 Intelligent Payment Decision Engine
**Goal**: Create AI agents that make autonomous payment decisions across all companies

**Centralized Agent Types**:

1. **Budget Guardian Agent**
   - Monitors ALL department spending across ALL companies
   - Learns patterns across your entire platform
   - Provides company-specific and cross-company insights
   - Scales intelligence with more data

2. **Universal Approval Agent**
   - Analyzes requests using data from ALL companies
   - Learns from successful/failed payments across platform
   - Provides increasingly accurate decisions
   - Company-specific policy enforcement

3. **Master Payment Execution Agent**
   - Handles payments for ALL companies through your single app
   - Optimizes payment batching across companies
   - Centralized retry and failure handling
   - Unified payment monitoring

4. **Smart Reimbursement Agent**

### 2.2 Simplified Agent Communication
```typescript
interface AgentRequest {
  companyId: string;
  requestId: string;
  type: 'approval' | 'payment' | 'reimbursement';
  data: any;
}

interface AgentResponse {
  decision: 'approve' | 'deny' | 'escalate';
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  paymentExecuted?: boolean;
}
```

## Phase 3: Streamlined Payment Flows

### 3.1 One-Click Purchase Processing
**Super Simple Flow**:
```
1. Employee submits request in YOUR app
2. AI agent analyzes (using YOUR Payman app data)
3. If approved ‚Üí Payment executes automatically  
4. Notifications sent ‚Üí Done!
```

### 3.2 Instant Reimbursements
```
1. Employee uploads receipt
2. AI categorizes and validates
3. Funds transfer to employee wallet immediately
4. Expense recorded in company books
```
