# BudgetAI + Payman Integration Plan
## Making Budget Management Cool and Agentic with Direct Wallet Payments

### Executive Summary
Transform your budget management system into an intelligent, autonomous financial platform where AI agents make smart payment decisions and execute transfers directly to employees' wallets using Payman's programmable payment infrastructure.

---

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Radix UI components
- **Backend**: MongoDB with Mongoose, Next.js API routes
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Current Features**:
  - User/Company/Department management
  - Purchase request workflow
  - Budget tracking and analytics
  - Basic AI decision making (mock)

### Existing Payman Integration
- ✅ **Single Payman App Already Created** (Simplified Approach)
- Basic SDK setup in `src/lib/payman/payman.js`
- Test credentials configured
- Simple wallet operations (list, create payee, send test funds)

---

## **SIMPLIFIED AUTHENTICATION FLOW**

### Single App Architecture 🎯
**Your existing Payman app handles ALL companies and users**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero Payman setup required for new companies
- ✅ Seamless user onboarding with company codes
- ✅ Centralized wallet management
- ✅ Simplified maintenance

### Enhanced Company Code Onboarding Flow:
```
1. Company Admin → Signs up + creates company profile
2. System generates unique company code (already implemented)
3. ✨ Company wallet created automatically via your Payman app
4. Admin shares company code with employees
5. Employee → Signs up + enters company code during onboarding
6. ✨ Employee wallet created automatically + linked to company
7. Employee immediately has access to budget system!
```

### Company Code Integration Benefits:
- ✅ **Self-Service**: Employees onboard themselves (no admin workload)
- ✅ **Automatic Linking**: Company code connects employee to right company database
- ✅ **Instant Wallet**: Employee wallet created during signup process
- ✅ **Secure**: Only employees with valid company code can join

### No More Complex Flows:
- ❌ No individual Payman app registration per company
- ❌ No client ID/secret sharing with users
- ❌ No manual employee invitations needed
- ❌ No technical Payman knowledge required

## Phase 1: Enhanced Payman Integration

### 1.1 Company Code + Wallet Integration
**Goal**: Seamlessly integrate wallet creation with your existing company code system

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Enhanced Company Creation Flow**
   ```typescript
   // When company admin creates company
   async function createCompanyWithWallet(companyData: CompanySetup) {
     // Create company in your database (existing logic)
     const company = await createCompany(companyData);
     
     // Generate company code (existing logic)  
     const companyCode = generateCompanyCode();
     
     // ✨ NEW: Auto-create company wallet
     const wallet = await payman.ask(`Create a USD wallet for company ${company.name}`);
     
     // Update company with wallet info
     await updateCompany(company.id, {
       joinCode: companyCode,
       paymanWalletId: wallet.id
     });
     
     return { company, companyCode, wallet };
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Employee Onboarding with Wallet Creation**
   ```typescript
   // When employee signs up with company code
   async function onboardEmployeeWithWallet(
     employeeData: SignUpFormValues, 
     companyCode: string
   ) {
     // Validate company code (existing logic)
     const company = await findCompanyByCode(companyCode);
     if (!company) throw new Error('Invalid company code');
     
     // Create employee account (existing logic)
     const employee = await createEmployee({
       ...employeeData,
       companyId: company.id
     });
     
     // ✨ NEW: Auto-create employee wallet
     const wallet = await payman.ask(
       `Create a TSD wallet for employee ${employee.name} at ${company.name}`
     );
     
     // Link wallet to employee
     await updateEmployee(employee.id, {
       paymanWalletId: wallet.id
     });
     
     return { employee, wallet };
   }
   ```

3. **Unified Policy Management by Company Code**
   ```typescript
   interface PaymentPolicy {
     companyCode: string;  // Links to your existing system
     companyId: string;
     departmentId: string;
     employeeRole: string;
     dailyLimit: number;
     transactionLimit: number;
     approvalThreshold: number;
     allowedCategories: string[];
   }
   
   // Apply policies automatically when employee joins
   async function applyCompanyPolicies(employeeId: string, companyCode: string) {
     const policies = await getPoliciesByCompanyCode(companyCode);
     await assignPoliciesToEmployee(employeeId, policies);
   }
   ```

### 1.2 Company Code Dashboard Enhancement
**Goal**: Give company admins visibility into code-based onboarding

**Features**:
- View all employees who joined via company code
- Track wallet creation success/failures  
- Monitor new employee onboarding in real-time
- Regenerate company codes if needed
- Bulk policy application for code-based joiners

### 1.3 Employee Self-Service Wallet Management
**Goal**: Let employees manage their auto-created wallets

**Features**:
- View wallet balance and transaction history
- Connect personal wallet for reimbursements (optional)
- Update wallet preferences and notifications
- Request wallet permissions changes

---

## Phase 2: AI Agent Architecture

### 2.1 Intelligent Payment Decision Engine
**Goal**: Create AI agents that make autonomous payment decisions across all companies

**Centralized Agent Types**:

1. **Budget Guardian Agent**
   - Monitors ALL department spending across ALL companies
   - Learns patterns across your entire platform
   - Provides company-specific and cross-company insights
   - Scales intelligence with more data

2. **Universal Approval Agent**
   - Analyzes requests using data from ALL companies
   - Learns from successful/failed payments across platform
   - Provides increasingly accurate decisions
   - Company-specific policy enforcement

3. **Master Payment Execution Agent**
   - Handles payments for ALL companies through your single app
   - Optimizes payment batching across companies
   - Centralized retry and failure handling
   - Unified payment monitoring

4. **Smart Reimbursement Agent**
   - Processes reimbursements across all companies
   - Learns expense patterns platform-wide
   - Instant transfers to employee wallets
   - Cross-company fraud detection

### 2.2 Simplified Agent Communication
```typescript
interface AgentRequest {
  companyId: string;
  requestId: string;
  type: 'approval' | 'payment' | 'reimbursement';
  data: any;
}

interface AgentResponse {
  decision: 'approve' | 'deny' | 'escalate';
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  paymentExecuted?: boolean;
}
```

## Phase 3: Streamlined Payment Flows

### 3.1 One-Click Purchase Processing
**Super Simple Flow**:
```
1. Employee submits request in YOUR app
2. AI agent analyzes (using YOUR Payman app data)
3. If approved → Payment executes automatically  
4. Notifications sent → Done!
```

### 3.2 Instant Reimbursements
```
1. Employee uploads receipt
2. AI categorizes and validates
3. Funds transfer to employee wallet immediately
4. Expense recorded in company books
```

### 3.3 Zero-Config Budget Management
- Companies just set budgets in your app
